# Toaster

Toast Notifier for Windows.

## How to Use

```powershell
toaster.ps1 xml\sample.xml
```

or

```powershell
powershellLauncher.vbs toaster.ps1 xml\sample.xml
```

When you want to launch Toaster with background process, you should use the latter way, since ps1 file can't run as background process with itself.
